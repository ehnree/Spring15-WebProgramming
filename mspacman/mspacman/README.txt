Lab: Ms. Pac Man
Author: Henry Zhou
Date: 3/3/2015

1) In this assignment, implementation of the canvas API to draw
a blue Ms.Pac Man board along with a Ms.Pac Man player was successfully 
done. This was done by running the javascript file game.js. Game.js
loads the entire Ms.Pac Man sprite into an image. Slicing techniques
are used to then draw various parts of the sprite onto the canvas. 

All slices were done with estimated dimensions. 

Note: For some reason, the Ms. Pac Man sprite seems to be lower resolution than the sample. 

2) All work was done solo.

3) 45 minutes
