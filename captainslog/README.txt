Captains Log

1) The webpage successfully implements jQuery to reference HTML 
tags and their values. The webpage successfully takes in text input,
prepends it within a single object (a list of all messages) in HTML format
with the date it was submitted to the localStorage, prints the message with the date on the page, and clears the text box after submitting. 



2) Brian Williamson assisted me with showing only messages
sent in from the webpage when accessing the localStorage. 

3) Time spent on lab: 1 hour
