Git Repository of Henry Zhou for COMP20

Purpose

The purpose of this git repository is to store and display past projects
completed for COMP20: Web Programming for the Spring 2015 school semester.

Favorite Assignment

My favorite assignment in this class so far has been the semester group project. I enjoy it because my project revolves around working on something I am interested in. I have particularly learned a lot about front end programming, such as user UI and design. The group collaboration aspect is also good training for real life work where teamwork is integral to success.

Growth Reflection

I think I have grown significantly since day 1 of this course. The best way to describe my growth would be horizontally; I have received a little experience in a broad array of web programming topics. I am glad I was able to get such wide exposure so I could try different things.

Most Important Lesson

The most important thing that I learned from this course was that self-learning is very powerful. Oftentimes, I found myself required to create something that was not covered completely in lecture. Consequently, I had to spend a lot of time using other resources such as reaching out on Piazza or stackOverflow for the answers. What I realized was that there are a lot of useful resources on the internet and a little research can go a long way in programming. Aside from forums, I learned the importance about reading documentation. Although sometimes confusing, the documentation is ultimately a resource and should always be consulted when using a tool/API/language.

Moving On

I would like to move on further into front end user design. I like creating pragmatic, beautiful solutions and enjoy the type of problem solving presented by designing interfaces. I'd also like to work more on my back end skills so I can better understand the entire anatomy of a full fledged website. Although our time with security was limited,I think it is a fascinating topic and would like to give it more tries in the future.
