<p>COMP20 - Security Report <br>
Written by Henry Zhou</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Today's technological world moves at a breakneck pace. From frameworks to databases to applications, there is a seemingly 
endless stream of new technological applications and tools that are released each day. However, with new technologies come
new security and privacy issues. Holes in security garner the interest of malicious hackers who seek to capitalize
on these security flaws. <p>

<p>The following is a report regarding gauging the security and privacy level of a web application. 
	The web application is the Second and Third Comp20 Assignment <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-jcaccamo/mmap/"> Marauder's Map</a>
	built by Jacob Caccamo.
application retrieves location data from the client via a unique login, stores the data in a MongoDB database, and displays a Google Map 
with pins at the latitude and longitude of all other users stored in the database. <p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>The main method of testing for security issues was making POST requests to the web application. This was conducted using 
the Postman - REST Client Google Chrome WebApp. A variety of different inputs were posted to the web application and their
impacts were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Black box testing was utilized initially, but further analysis 
was conducted along with white box testing. </p>

<p> Testing environment: </p>
<ul>
	<li> Performed on a Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop with Intel(R) Core i3, 6GB RAM, Windows 8.1 64-bit</li>
	<li> Internet Connection: TuftsWireless </li>
	<li> Internet Browser: Google Chrome </li>
</ul>

<h3>Abstract of Findings</h3> 

<p>Most if not all security issues that arose were directly caused by
malicious or mismanaged user input. For example, user input could be
used to inject code that would run on other user's browsers. The consequences are as open ended as the code; injected code from
an outside source range from annoying popups to making a website 
completely inaccessible.<p>

<!-- Issues Found - For each issue that you find, document:
Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
Location / page where issue was found
Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.

<h3>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) </h3>

<p> Location: GET '/' API </p>

<p> Description:
	Cross site scripting is totally undefended against by the web application. Attacks could be executed by writing a Javascript
	script as an input field of the POST API. The GET '/' API then
	prints out all the fields of each document in the web app 
	collection on the client browser. The effect is any Javascript
	contained in any document's field is executed by the client's
	browser. 
</p>

<div class="label"> Consequence of Cross Domain Scripting while making a request to the GET '/' API </div>

<p>Severity: HIGH 
	Injection of Javascript from user input can have crippling impacts 
	on a website's security and privacy. Although the extent of the XSS
	injected for this study was relatively harmless, Javascript can
	easily be used maliciously. Examples include redirecting users that
	load the script to malicious webpages, which may themselves have 
	malicious Javascript. Such Javascript can be used to steal 
	sensitive information stored in the client's browser, such as 
	login information for websites. With a user's login information,
	the hacker can use this information to access user accounts with
	personal information such as a person's name, address, and phone number. However, the consequences may be far more severe if the login information grants the hacker access to a website that stores the user's social security number, credit card information, medical 
	information, etc.. </p>

<p> Discovery:
	An attack can be conducted by making a POST request with a script
	injected within one of the required fields in the request. </p>

<img src="xss.jpg">
<div class="label"> Scripts can be injected via the sendLocation POST API </div>

<p>Resolution: 
	When printing &gt; or &lt;, cleanse input by outputting "&amp;lt;" and "&amp;gt;" instead. This prevents "&lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;" from being outputted on the 
		user browser. Consequently, any script injected will not be injected 
		as the browser will not execute the script since the script is contained within "&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;". </p>



<h3>Lack of Restriction on Input Size </h3>

<p>Location: POST API <p>

<p>Description:
	There is no limit explicitly set by the client or server side of 
	the web app on the size of user input submitted. Consequently, extremely large documents may be stored in the web app database.
	Generally, user input should rarely exceed even several tens of bytes as only login (string), lat (float), and lng (float) are 
	used per document. However, a very large string can be stored in
	the login field of the user input and be stored in the database. This
	presents a large security issue as this exploit can be used to maliciously affect website performance. </p>

<p> Severity: HIGH  <br>
	
	There is definitely a direct correlation between the time it takes to execute the sendLocation API as evidenced in the examples below.
</p>
<img src="720.jpg"> 
<div class="label"> Time /sendLocation takes to process when size of response is 720kb </div> 
<img src="792.jpg">
<div class="label"> Time /sendLocation takes to process when size of response is 792kb </div> 

<img src="sendlocation_chart.jpg">
<div class="label"> Chart of average load times based on various samples taken at different sizes </div> 
<p>

	Consequently, it is fair to extrapolate that when scaled, the effects of overloading the server on purpose can severely slow down
	the web application. This can cause other effects such as crash the server due to the massive sizes of requests. The impacts would be
	especially noticeable when an attack is scaled 10x, 100x, 1000x ... etc.  <br> <br>

	Also, the fact that no size limit exists goes hand in hand with XSS attacks. The result is very sophisticated scripts can be written and run
	on user's browsers, whereas a limit could prevent a longer, more complicated and harmful script from being injected in the first place. <br> <br>

	Although load times are also dependent on a user's machine and internet connection speed, generally the larger the file that is sent, the more
	time is takes a computer for it to load relative to itself. Consequently, it is extremely important to provide a limit to user input
	not only from a security/privacy perspective but also performance. 


</p>

<p>Discovery:
	This issue was discovered when making POST requests with extremely large user input. A large text file (~92kb) would be stored within the login field of the user input. The login would then be slightly edited to store another unique document of extremely large size in the database. The process was repeated numerous times until the size of the response exceeded one MB. </p>


<p>Resolution: 

One easy solution is to check the size of the request. A simple way to do this is to access the "content-length" field of the request header. A reasonable limit would be bytes. This provides ample space to provide a login, latitude, and longitude for user's.

<h3>Unsanitized Latitude and Longitude Fields</h3>

<p>Location: POST API <p>

<p>Description:
	The range of valid latitudes lies between -90 and 90. The range of valid longitudes lies between -180 and 180. Users however
	can manually make posts with latitudes and longitudes of any number. </p>

<p> Severity: LOW  <br>
	
	The implications of this security hole are relatively minor. Upon making a request with invalid longitudes and latitudes, the Google Maps API
	seems to parse out invalid locations on its own and those inputs are never pinned onto the Google Map. However, the invalid inputs still
	take up space in the database. 


</p>

<p>Discovery:
	This issue was discovered when making POST requests with invalid longitude and latitude values.  </p>

<img src="latlng.jpg">
<div class="label"> Successful POST request with invalid latitude and longitude </div>
<p>Resolution: 

One easy solution is to check the value of the latitudes and longitudes. A simple way to do this is to write a simple conditional that checks 
to see if the fields are genuine.

<p>Conclusion:</p>

It is imperative that the two issues found whose severities were indicated HIGH be resolved immedietely. The fixes are generally simple and should not take too long. However, there may be much more security flaws with this web application than written in this report. In fact, there may be security flaws
that have not yet been discovered that may someday plague this website. Consequently, it is important that websites and applications be constantly
monitored in case of new types of attacks. Whether it happens to this website or another one, every website is fair game for a potential
hacker. Fortunately, I would be happy to provide future security consulting services in the future and I am committed to keeping your website up and running
for the benefit of both you and your users.
